# Introduction to geemap

Description

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It enables scientists, researchers, and developers to analyze and visualize changes on the Earthâ€™s surface. The geemap Python package provides GEE users with an intuitive interface to manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data interactively in a Jupyter-based environment. The topics to be covered in this workshop include:

- Introducing geemap and the Earth Engine Python API
- Creating interactive maps
- Searching GEE data catalog
- Displaying GEE datasets
- Classifying images using machine learning algorithms
- Computing statistics and exporting results
- Producing publication-quality maps
- Building and deploying interactive web apps, among others
This workshop is intended for scientific programmers, data scientists, geospatial analysts, and concerned citizens of Earth. The attendees are expected to have a basic understanding of Python and the Jupyter ecosystem. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is useful but not required.
