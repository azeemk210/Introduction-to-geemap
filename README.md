# Introduction to geemap

Description

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It enables scientists, researchers, and developers to analyze and visualize changes on the Earthâ€™s surface. The geemap Python package provides GEE users with an intuitive interface to manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data interactively in a Jupyter-based environment. The topics to be covered in this workshop include:

Introducing geemap and the Earth Engine Python API
Creating interactive maps
Searching GEE data catalog
Displaying GEE datasets
Classifying images using machine learning algorithms
Computing statistics and exporting results
Producing publication-quality maps
Building and deploying interactive web apps, among others
This workshop is intended for scientific programmers, data scientists, geospatial analysts, and concerned citizens of Earth. The attendees are expected to have a basic understanding of Python and the Jupyter ecosystem. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is useful but not required.
